    <h2>Oshawa</h2>
    <p>Oshawa is a city in Ontario, Canada, located on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, approximately 60 kilometers east of downtown Toronto. It serves as the largest municipality in the Regional Municipality of Durham and is often considered the eastern anchor of the Greater Toronto Area and the Golden Horseshoe.
    </p>
    <p>The name ‚ÄúOshawa‚Äù is derived from an Ojibwa term meaning ‚Äúthe crossing place‚Äù or simply ‚Äúa cross,‚Äù reflecting its historical significance as a transportation hub.
